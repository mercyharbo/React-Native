# Movie App using TMDB API 

### This is my first React Native app, I work with the TMDB API using it to buuild a movie app to integrate the following:

- Login with your TMDB logins to the app but can't signup, still trying to understand the API
- Listed trending movies and tv shows
- Created a modal that show when you want to view movie or tv show details where you will find more informations 
- Search page where once you enter 3 letters of your search keys to the input it start suggesting related stuff to what you enter or person
- Display upcoming movies or tv shows 
- Some kind of slide for trending movies on the home 

# Moving forward: 
- I'd like to make the logout functionable
- Load users info, watchlist or maybe favoritte 
- Add movies or tv shows trailer to the movie imformation 
- And maybe little UI changes though or improvement.

# What I was able to learn during this project:

- I was able to learn how to use various React Native stuff like Text, button, Image, TextInput
- TouchOpacity, onPress function that trigger a function just like the onClick in Reactjs or JavaScript,
- View which is like a wrapper to our attributes just like div element in the React or HTML
- FlatList which works like map in React, ot's used to load tons of large data from fetch from an API or anywhere 
- ScrollView works likely the same with FlatList but it's not advisible to use it to load large data, it also allow you to make a scrollable layout of your app but not advisible wwrapping FlatList with ScrollView at all
- And Stylesheet which is a way of styling of our app to our taste with some features and little twist which won't be a problem for someone with good knowledge of pure CSS
- ActivityIndicator which is used for the loading state of the fetch or the app rather
